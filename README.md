# Signature Detection on Documents Using YOLOv5

## Overview

This project aims to detect signatures on scanned documents using the YOLOv5 object detection model. It involves collecting and labeling a tobacco dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance to achieve accurate real-time signature detection.

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for efficient and accurate signature detection.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
