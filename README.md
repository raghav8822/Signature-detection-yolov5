# Signature Detection on Documents Using YOLOv5

## Overview

This project aims to detect signatures on scanned documents using the YOLOv5 object detection model. It involves collecting and labeling a tobacco dataset, training the model, and evaluating its performance to achieve accurate real-time signature detection.

- **Real-time Detection**: Utilizes YOLOv5 for efficient and accurate signature detection.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- Git
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab or Google Colab

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/signature-detection-yolov5.git
    cd signature-detection-yolov5
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. **Add YOLO formatted tobacco dataset to Yolov5 folder**
   - I took it from here - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ttDGq_T2dprXJl0Y1lQP1ys64c0_a_hU 

3. **Add YAML in Yolov5 folder**

4. **Edit given train.py to add your drive path**

5. **Run code and make sure to edit paths as per your requirements**
